## Hi, I'm Zaynab! ðŸ‘‹

### A little bit about me:
- I'm currently working on my data analysis skills.
- So far I have done:
    - The Google Analytics Certificate (Coursera)
    - The University of Michigan py3 Specialisation
    - A 12 week Data Skills for the Energy Transfer accelerator programme offered by Shell
    - PL-300 Power BI Data Analysis Microsoft Certification
-  I started my journey with data anlysis after getting a First-Class Maths & Statistics BSc (Hons) in 2022.
-  And I'm currently ... enrolled on the AI Core Data Analytics pathway!

(__I'm very new to GitHub so this is very much a work in progress.__)
